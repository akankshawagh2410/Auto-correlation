# Auto-correlation

The monthly time series consisting of returns on:

•30 industry (Food, Beer, Smoke, etc)
•Market-risk free (M-r)

•SMB (Small minus big)

•HML (High minus low)

•RF (Riskfreerate)

•Momentum

Part1: Form the correlation matrix between all these time series. For the four-factor model (market-RF, SMB, HML, and Momentum), which factor correlates most highly with every industry? Which factor correlates negatively with every industry? Does RF (Riskfreerate) correlate highly with 30 industry time series?

Part2: Form the auto-correlation function (ACF) for time-lag 1 to time-lag 10 with the four-factor time series (market-RF, SMB, HML, and Momentum).  Is there any AR(1) model in the 4 time series? Explain your observations.
